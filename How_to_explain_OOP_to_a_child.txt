-4 principles of OOP:
  --Encapsulation
  --Abstraction
  --Inheritance
  --Polymorphism
-Encapsulation:
  --Objects have states, which are PRIVATE and can not be changed externally.
  --Though we can not change the states, we can affect them by the public methods.
  --E.g: -A cat class has its private states: hungry, mood and energy and private method meow() which will be called whenever it wants
         -We can not change the states of the cats, for example, decide when the cat is hungry, it is private.
         -But we can communicate with its states by public methods like feed() or play(), which provide a link to the states.
