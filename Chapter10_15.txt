Chapter 10: Array
-Sequence of objects of sametype.
-Array declaration: data_type array_name[size (or number of maximum elements)];
                    data_type array_name[size(optional)] = {elements (separated by ',')};
-To access an element in array: array_name[index]
-Index is counted from 0

Chapter 11: Pointer
-Pointer is a variable that stores other variables' address on memory.
-A pointer can only point to a variable of the same type.
-Pointer declaration: data_type* ptr_name;
-Assigning value to pointer: ptr_name = &variable_name;
                             ptr_name = array_name; >> The pointer will take the address of the first element in array.
-As pointer stores variable's address, we can change one's value through pointer: int a = 1; int* ptr; ptr = &a; *ptr = 5; --> a = 5

Chapter 12: References
-Somewhat similar to pointer: also change one variable's value by accessing its address.
-When using reference, both reference and variable's value will be changed even the value of reference or variable is changed.
-Syntax: int x;
         int& y = x;
