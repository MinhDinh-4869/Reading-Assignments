-What is OOP??
  --OOP is a programming paradigm where everything is based on classes and objects.
  --Class is a blueprint, which is used to create objects.
  --Objects has States and Methods:
    ---States are the properties of an object
    ---Methods are the functions, which can be used to interact with objects' states
-Benefits of OOP:
  --OOP models complex things as reproducible, simple structures
  --Reusable, OOP objects can be used across programs
  --Allows for class-specific behavior through polymorphism
  --Easier to debug, classes often contain all applicable information to them
  --Secure, protects information through encapsulation
-How to structure OOP programs:
  --Create a parent class
  --Create a child class
  --Add unique states and behaviours
  --Create objects from a child class
-Building blocks of OOP:
  --Classes:are essentially user-defined data types, where we can create a template for structure of attributes and methods
  --Objects: are instances created with specific data
  --Attributes: are the information that is stored, defined in the class template, when objects are
  instaniated individual objects contain data stored in the Attributes field.
  --Methods: represent behaviors, perform actions, return information about an object of update an object's data. Defined
  in the class definition.
